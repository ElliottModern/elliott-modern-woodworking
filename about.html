                    My attention to detail has led me to pursue a diverse range of opportunities in which I could develop and hone my skills. My career has taken me from designing custom spaces for the restaurant and hospitality industries, to implementing 3D design software for a custom millwork production shop, and currently to designing specialty vehicles that serve as mobile communication command centers.
                    <br><br>
                    Through these experiences, I have discovered my true passion:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Building</strong> and <strong>Custom Design.</strong>

                <p>
                    As a mechanical engineer, I have always recognized the importance of materials in my designs. I have had the opportunity to work with a wide range of materials, including metals, woods, and composites. However, it is wood that has particularly captured my attention and inspired me to focus on woodworking.
                    <br><br>
                    I find that wood adds a warmth and welcoming touch to a design that cannot be achieved with cold, hard materials such as metal and concrete. Additionally, the natural grain and color variations in wood allow me to incorporate a touch of the organic and wild into my modern, straight-lined and angular designs. Overall, I believe that the contrast between the modern and the natural elements creates a unique and striking aesthetic in my work.
